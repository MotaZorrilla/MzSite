                        <p class="fst-italic">
                            As an engineer, I thrive on problem-solving and innovation, consistently seeking new
                            challenges to apply my expertise.
                            My experience encompasses a wide range of engineering projects, from power systems design to
                            automation and control. <br>

                            In parallel, my journey as a web developer has allowed me to explore the dynamic
                            intersection of technology and creativity.
                            I specialize in crafting elegant and user-friendly web experiences,
                            utilizing a blend of front-end and back-end technologies to bring ideas to life on the
                            digital canvas. My interest in artificial intelligence dates back to before its recent boom,
                            allowing me to approach the field with a unique and seasoned perspective.
